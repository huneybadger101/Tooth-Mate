Tooth Mate project

Description:
The Tooth Mate project is to develop comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software for dental professionals. The software aims to streamline appointment management, enable voice note-taking, and store dental graphics and images as dynamic 3D models. Moreover, it is designed to ensure seamless data export to the Tooth Mate mobile app. This project's goal is to facilitate effective and efficient dental practice management, allowing dentists to concentrate more on providing quality patient care.

A brief summary of the project and its purpose:
The purpose of this project is to continue developing the Tooth Mate app from last year's students, which will facilitate communication between dentists and their patients. This will be particularly helpful for parents with young children as it will help them start an oral healthcare routine with their kids. The app aims to promote oral health in New Zealand, where the oral health system is poorly functioning, causing long wait lists for patients. By providing accessible and understandable dental information and advice through the app, the project aims to minimize the amount of treatment that patients must pay for in the long run, reducing costs and increasing continuity of care.â€¯Our role in this project is to continue the development of Tooth Mate to get a workable prototype running that the client can present to potential investors.
